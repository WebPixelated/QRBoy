# QRBoy: Retro QR Code Generator

**QRBoy** is an interactive web application that generates QR codes within a retro handheld console-style frame.

## Key Features

- **Instant QR Code Generation:** Type any text or URL into the input field and watch the QR code generate in real-time.
- **Retro Handheld Aesthetic:** The QR code is displayed within a meticulously designed SVG that resembles a classic Game Boy, creating a unique and fun user experience.
- **Customizable Color Palettes:** Choose from a selection of curated 4-color palettes to customize the look of your QRBoy. The "Default" palette is applied on startup, but you can explore other themes inspired by retro gaming.
- **Export in SVG & PNG:** Download your generated QRBoy as a high-quality, scalable SVG or a web-ready PNG file, perfect for both digital and print use.
